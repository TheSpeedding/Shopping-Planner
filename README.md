# Shopping Planner
In this application, a user can create an unlimited amount of shopping lists. All the information are stored in the database. Log-in mechanism uses PHP built-in sessions, session id is stored at the client-side as a cookie. Another cookie used in the application is id of the last viewed list. This cookie is emptied everytime when the user tries to log-out. Combination of these two cookies results in a fact, that everytime when a website with the application is opened, then the last viewed list is shown. Application itself uses front-controller design pattern to process requests. Response to the request is returned in a JSON string, in which message from the server is stored, as well as a requested content, if the request was successful. Most of the requests are processed using AJAX technology, even though you can find parts written in pure PHP, too.
